## What is this?

The Nuxt.js Firebase Module is a module that helps you integrate the Firebase JavaScript SDK into your application with ease. By simply configuring this module in your nuxt.config.js file, you can use all Firebase Services throughout your app.

By importing each individual Firebase service dynamically this module reduces bundle sizes and improves performance of your Nuxt.js app with Firebase.

The module additionally adds other perks such as a plugin that automated the setup of onAuthStateChanged() for Firebase Authentication or other helper functions that make your life with Firebase easier.

## How does it work?

The module adds a plugin to your Nuxt.js application that handles the initialization of each Firebase service (Authentication, Firestore, etc.). It then injects these services into the global context which makes them easily available throughout your application.
